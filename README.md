This repository contains a Perl code example demonstrating a common off-by-one error during array iteration. The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version. The error arises from incorrectly calculating the loop's upper bound when accessing array elements.  The solution addresses this by using the `$#array` scalar to correctly determine the last index. The bug is explained in detail in the respective files' comments.
